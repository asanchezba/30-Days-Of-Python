### Day 18 - 30 Days of Python Challenge ###

'''A regular expression or RegEx is a special text string 
that helps to find patterns in data. A RegEx can be used to 
check if some pattern exists in a different data type. To use RegEx 
in python first we should import the RegEx module which is called re.'''

import re

# Methods in re Module

''' To find a pattern we use different set of re character sets that allows to search for a match in a string.

re.match(): searches only in the beginning of the first line of the string and returns matched objects if found, else returns None.
re.search: Returns a match object if there is one anywhere in the string, including multiline strings.
re.findall: Returns a list containing all matches
re.split: Takes a string, splits it at the match points, returns a list
re.sub: Replaces one or many matches within a string'''

match = re.match('I love to teach', txt, re.I)

# Lets find the start and stop position from the span
start, end = span
